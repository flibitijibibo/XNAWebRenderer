Dependency Advisory
-------------------
XNAWebRenderer makes use of the Chromium Embedded Framework:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_Embedded_Framework

The dependency list of CEF is _huge_. If you find that you are unable to run
the program, check the libcef file for libraries your system may not have.

Developer Advisory
------------------
On GNU/Linux, CEF will crash if you do not have libcef.so preloaded before
program execution. The bug report can be found here (marked as WONTFIX):

https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/issues/1446/linux-crash-in-bitmapcontentlayerupdater#comment-20229311

The solution is to use LD_PRELOAD to load the library before executing the
MonoKickstart runtime. The change will look like this, for example:

LD_PRELOAD="libcef.so"
./XNAWebRenderer.bin.x86_64
